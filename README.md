# staff
Web Services Framework for C++ based on Axis2/C

Documentation for WSF Staff can be found here: https://github.com/loentar/staff/tree/wiki

This project is obsolete since Axis2/C is no longer maintained. You can still create issue or pull request.

If you need JSON REST webservices framework consider using https://github.com/loentar/ngrest instead.
It's even more easy in use than Staff and faster when comparing to Axis2/C + Staff.
